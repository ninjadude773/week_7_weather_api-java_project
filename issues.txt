I really couldnt figure out what I am doing wrong.
I literally used the Race car API as a reference 
and Im getting a fetch error as well as a Dev Tools error that I had not been 
getting in the Race Car Project.

The Dev Tools error gives me the perception that my HTML file isnt being 
read properly. 

Not sure if its because I am using boot strap or using it improperly. 

Im not sure whats going on with my fetch request to cause an error. 

I did the best that I could. Also I wanted to focus on getting data to populate in
one of my rows and then I would fill the following rows based off of how I coded the original
one. 

At this point I dont want to stress myself out even more and keep running around
in circles if I dont know what the issues are.
